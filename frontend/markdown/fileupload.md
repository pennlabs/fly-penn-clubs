# Penn Clubs: File Upload Guide

Hi there! 👋

Whether you want to upload files to pass down to your next set of board members, or uploading your club's constitution, follow the steps of this guide to be able to store important files right on Penn Clubs! **Please note that this guide will show you how to upload files that are only viewable to your club and Penn Clubs administrators**. If you are looking to upload a presentation or video for potential members to see, please follow the steps of [this guide](https://pennclubs.com/guides/media).

## 👩‍👧‍👦 Getting Officer Access 

In order to upload files, you need to be listed as an officer for your club. To check whether or not you have officer status, click your name in the upper-right corner to view the clubs you are listed under.

If the actions button says "Manage", click this button to be redirected to manage your club page. If your club is not listed here, or the button says "Leave", it means you do not have officer status for your club on Penn Clubs. Please contact a member of your club who is an officer to grant you access by following [these steps](https://pennclubs.com/guides/fair#managingmembers), or by emailing contact@pennclubs.com with your PennKey and club name.
