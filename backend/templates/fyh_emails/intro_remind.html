<h2>Submit Hub@Penn Resource by December 2</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Thank you to everyone who has already completed your <a href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/">Hub@Penn</a> resource
    page!</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    As a reminder, the all-new <a href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/">Hub@Penn</a> platform is as a place for Penn students to find and connect with support resources.
    This platform comes at the request of Penn's senior administration and after close collaboration with NSOAI, OLI,
    Penn Labs, and VPUL. We look forward to offering Hub@Penn as a resource for Penn students starting in advance of the
    Spring 2021 semester.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">We recently hosted (and recorded) a demo of the platform which provides a background of the
    platform development as well as instructions on how to add your resource. To view the 20-minute demo, click <a
        href="https://upenn.box.com/s/f9gtow2jxvdnlm0kf66t2c8i2p6znerm">here</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold">
    If you have not created your resource page by the deadline â€“ December 2, please <a href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/create">submit</a> your information as soon as
    possible. We hope to have our initial phase of primary resource pages completed by December 3. Please note - you may
    also edit your entry at any time.

<ul>{% for resource in resources %}<li><b>{{ resource }}</b></li>{% endfor %}</ul>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">If there is another more appropriate contact to serve as the liaison between your resource
    and the Hub@Penn administrators, please feel free to forward this message and/or let us know who we should contact
    in future communications.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">To account for rapid changes throughout 2020 and in preparation for the start of the Spring
    2021 semester, you are welcome to provide general information about your resource, directing students to your
    website for the most up-to-date information.
