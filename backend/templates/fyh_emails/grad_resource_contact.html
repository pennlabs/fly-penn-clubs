<h2>Grad Resources, We Need Your Help!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">Hello!</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
  Pennâ€™s newest online spot for resources launched earlier this semester.
  Hub@Penn is a one-stop shop for all resources within the Penn community.
  Originally born out of a vision of easing access to Penn resources for
  incoming first-year students, Hub@Penn is expanding to be inclusive of the
  needs of all Penn students. As such, <b>we need your help!</b> We are reaching
  out to Penn resources specifically tailored to meet the needs of Graduate and
  Professional Penn students. That includes you!

    <a href="https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/create">Hub@Penn Submission Form</a>
    form which gathers key information about your resource. You have been

  If there is another, more appropriate contact to serve as the liaison between
  your resource and the Hub@Penn administrators, please feel free to forward
  this message and/or let us know who we should contact for future
  communications.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
  Thank you in advance for taking the time to ensure easy access to your
  resource through Hub@Penn and as always for the resources your office offers
  our Penn community.
