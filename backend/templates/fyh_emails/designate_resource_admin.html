<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Hi Campus Partners,
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    We hope this email finds you well and that your semester is off to great start! As we experience increased traffic
    on <a href=https://hub.provost.upenn.edu />Hub@Penn platform</a> with the new semester, <b>we are reaching out to
        all
        resources to ensure there is an active individual/team in charge of updating all information on your page</b>.
    If
    someone on your team needs to be granted access to manage your page, we wanted to be sure you know exactly how to do
    that!
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Granting access to edit your resource information is easy! Simply navigate to your resource on Hub@Penn and click
    the green "Manage Resource" button.

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    <b>Please note that if one of your team members doesnâ€™t see a "Manage Resource" button on the resource page, this is
        because they currently don't have editing access to the resource.</b> The designated "Points of Contact" for the
    resource can grant access following the instructions above.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Once you have access to the resource, we also suggest taking a minute to look around and try out the tools we
    provide for managing and editing the resource such as events, mailing lists, FAQs, and analytics.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.2em">
    Please let us know if you have any questions.
</p>

    Best, </br> Hub@Penn Admin </br> <a href=https://hub.provost.upenn.edu />https://hub.provost.upenn.edu/</a>
